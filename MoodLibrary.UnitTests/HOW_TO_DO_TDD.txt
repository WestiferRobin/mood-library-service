Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. The process typically follows these steps:

1. **Write a Test**: Write a test that defines a function or improvement of a function.
2. **Run the Test**: Run the test and see it fail. This confirms that the test works and the functionality isn't already present.
3. **Write the Code**: Write the minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass.
4. **Run the Test Again**: Run the test and see it pass.
5. **Refactor**: Refactor the code to improve its structure and readability without changing its behavior. Ensure the test still passes.

When writing tests for your application, you should consider various types of tests to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability. Here are some key categories and examples of tests you should consider:

### Unit Tests
These tests focus on individual units of code (e.g., methods, classes) to ensure they work as expected in isolation.

1. **Positive Tests**: Verify that the code works correctly with valid inputs.
   - Example: `AddArtist_AddsValidArtist`
   
2. **Negative Tests**: Verify that the code handles invalid inputs and edge cases gracefully.
   - Example: `AddArtist_NullArtistDto_ThrowsArgumentNullException`
   
3. **Exception Tests**: Ensure the code throws appropriate exceptions when something goes wrong.
   - Example: `AddArtist_RepositoryThrowsException_ThrowsException`
   
4. **Boundary Tests**: Test the boundaries or limits of input values.
   - Example: Testing with the smallest and largest valid artist names.

### Integration Tests
These tests focus on the interactions between multiple units, ensuring they work together correctly.

1. **Repository Tests**: Verify that the repository correctly interacts with the database.
   - Example: Adding, updating, and deleting artists in the database.
   
2. **Service and Repository Interaction**: Ensure that the service correctly interacts with the repository.
   - Example: Adding an artist through the service and verifying it's stored in the database.

### Functional Tests
These tests focus on the overall functionality of the application from an end-user perspective.

1. **End-to-End Tests**: Verify the complete flow of the application.
   - Example: Adding an artist through the API and verifying it appears in the list of artists.

2. **UI Tests**: Ensure the user interface behaves as expected.
   - Example: Verifying that the artist form correctly submits and displays validation errors.

### Performance Tests
These tests focus on the performance characteristics of the application.

1. **Load Tests**: Ensure the application can handle a large number of requests or data.
   - Example: Testing the API with a high number of concurrent add artist requests.

2. **Stress Tests**: Determine the breaking point of the application under extreme conditions.
   - Example: Testing how the application behaves when the database is under heavy load.

### Security Tests
These tests focus on ensuring the application is secure against various threats.

1. **Authentication and Authorization Tests**: Verify that access controls are correctly enforced.
   - Example: Ensuring that only authorized users can add artists.

2. **Input Validation Tests**: Ensure that all inputs are properly validated to prevent injection attacks.
   - Example: Testing the artist name field for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
